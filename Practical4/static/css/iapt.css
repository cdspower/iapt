 * It allows me to use em as a unit easily in place of pixels (px) or point (pt)
 * in my fonts and layout.  Now 1.0em == 100% == 10px == 8pt, and so if I want
 * to make everything 200% bigger, I can specify 2.0em, which displays more
 * reliably in most major browsers.    Useful conversions available at: http://pxtoem.com/

 * spill out the edges.  The alternative is to use a fluid layout.
 * I also set the font size to be a minimum of 12px (1.2 em = 10 point font).
